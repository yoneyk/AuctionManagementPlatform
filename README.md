# AuctionManagementPlatform
A simple web based auction/bid management where users can register items and bid at the same time for other items. It is possible to track the status of the bid for the item a user bid for. Different latest technologies are used as a way to learning them. PHP5 and MySQL is used as a backend and HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap3 is used for a slick design in the frontend side.
